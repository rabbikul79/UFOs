## Summary:
This page only displaying static data from a given data file; not real time data

### Recommendation: 
 - Instead of data file the information can be stored by an API call from the hosted server to get Realtime data
 - The filter input box can be more interactive by replacing the text box into dropdown menu with avaiable data for the specific criteria
